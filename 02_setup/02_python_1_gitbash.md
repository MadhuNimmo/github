If you're a windows user, you'll need to download something called `gitbash`. If you're a mac user, your `terminal` will do the job.

So, for windows users, do the following steps:

- Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Download the Git windows setup (64-bit)
- Install the application
  - When it Prompts you to adjust your PATH environment you should pick the 3rd option Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt
  - You can choose the default options the installer already picked for you for other things

With this we're now ready to actually start explaining and using git. See you in the next chapter.
