To start using git, open up your terminal:

For windows, open gitbash that you've installed in the previous chapter.

For mac, open terminal. If you don't know how, click [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Mac)

In the next few sections, we'll start using git command by command. With each section, hopefully, things will be clearer.
