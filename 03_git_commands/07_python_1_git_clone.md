This command allows you to download an online git repo into your computer.

If you go to any repo on GitHub, there is a clone button which gives a url that you can use to download the repo.

This is the repo that I created in this workshop https://github.com/lailalelouch/test . You can just click on the `clone or download` button and copy the url that would look like this `https://github.com/lailalelouch/test.git` .

Finally, to clone/download it into you computer, you navigate in your terminal/gitbash where you want to download it and enter this command.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lailalelouch/test.git
```

You should now have a folder called `test` when you open this folder, you should see the files that I created in them.
