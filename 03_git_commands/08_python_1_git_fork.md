This command allows you to make a copy of a repo that someone has into your own github account. For example, right now the `test` repo that I have is under my account `lailalelouch`. You can simply fork it and you'll now have a repo under your account with the name `test` with the same files that I had.

You may ask why would I want to copy it?

well, let me answer...I wasn't finished yet. The whole idea of git and github is the version control where you can keep checkpoints different versions of your code/files that you can get back to. So, let's say someone has a certain project and you like it but want to modify a few things. So, you clone it/download it into your computer and then modify whatever files you want.

Next, let's say you want to make a checkpoint to these changes. So, you add, commit, and then finally push. But, the remote repo wasn't yours, so you cant really just upload it into their repo. This is where forking comes from.

So, instead of cloning their repo, you'll fork it and now you have your own copy. Clone that copy and now you can do whatever you want.

So, start by forking my test repo https://github.com/lailalelouch/test . You'll see there is a fork button on the top right side. just click that and the copying will happen. Simple enough, right?
