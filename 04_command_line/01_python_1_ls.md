This command is used to list out what's in your current directory/folder.

Once you open your command line(windows) or terminal(mac), start by typing `ls` for mac users and `dir` for windows users. This will list you all the files and folders inside of the folder you're currently in.

currently I'm in a folder that has one file called `notes.txt` and a folder called `pictures`. So, when I used the listing command, I got this:

```
$ ls
notes.txt     pictures
```
