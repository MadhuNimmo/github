This command stands for `change directory`. We can use it to go to a different directory.

For example, to navigate into the pictures folder/directory we'll do the following.

```
$ cd pictures
```

I went into the `pictures` folder by specifying the name of the folder that I want to get into after the `cd` command.

Now, if I wanted to see what's inside the pictures folder, what do you think we should do?....dancing potato time

```
$ ls
$ cat.png    shark.png
```

I used the `ls` command(`dir` for windows users) to print out what's inside the pictures folder.

Now, I decided that I want to leave this folder and go back to where the `notes.txt` and `pictures` were.

All I have to do is use the `cd` command with two dots to move one directory up go out of the pictures folder

```
$ cd ..
```

Now, let's check where we are

```
$ ls
notes.txt     pictures
```

and we're exactly where we want to be.

Keep in mind that you won't be getting the exact same files nor folders in your computer. So, take the time to try and navigating through different folders in your computer and seeing what they have inside using your terminal/command line.
