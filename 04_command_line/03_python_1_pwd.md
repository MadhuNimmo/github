The `pwd` command, which stands for print working directory, shows you your current directory.

In windows the command is also `cd` but without any parameters after it.

For example, if we're currently in the Desktop and we use this command we'll see this.

Mac:

```
$ pwd
/Users/laila/Desktop
$ cd pictures
$ pwd
/Users/laila/Desktop/pictures
```

Windows:

```
$ cd
/Users/laila/Desktop
$ cd pictures
$ cd
/Users/laila/Desktop/pictures
```

Please do take the time to test this command out before moving on.
